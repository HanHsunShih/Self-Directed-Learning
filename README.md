### Figma
Many software engineers need to collaborate across departments, and learning Figma enables me to communicate more effectively with design teams. Moreover, it allows me to gain a deeper understanding of UX and UI design principles, which is very helpful in developing more user-centric products. Additionally, given my background in illustration design, learning Figma will not only allow me to get up to speed quickly but also expand my skill set, making me more versatile and competitive in the field of software development.
